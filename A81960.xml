         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACcording to my Obligation, when I ſet forward in my Travels, of tranſmitting to you my Obſervations, and other Occurences; I am ſorry that my firſt Letter ſhould come frait with ſo Tragical a Story, which ſcarce ever was parallell'd, but in the dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of <hi>London:</hi> I queſtion not, but the Commemoration of your own Loſſes, in that, will cauſe a Chriſtian feeling and compaſſion in all that ſhall hear of this, for thoſe poor Wretches, that one hour gloried in their Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Relations and pleaſant Habitations; the next, was forc'd to wander in the Fields, with their parch'd Bodies, deſtitute of any Abode: But let the Relation ſpeak their doleful Condition.</p>
            <p>At <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dem,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>hien,</hi> a ſmall but Beautiful City, near <hi>Xanten,</hi> on the lower part of the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> that on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the Holy Week of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> in the Houſe of a <hi>Brewer;</hi> at the ſign of the <hi>Red-Hart,</hi> broak out a moſt dreadful Fire, which in an hour and half; or two hours at moſt, by it's Raging Flames, the whole City was turned into Aſhes, with all the Rich Furniture their Houſes were adorned with. The devouring Fire knew no difference betwixt things Sacred and Prophane; but equally in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt fell, the Monaſteries of the Regulars and Monks, the common Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in which was Stored the City Corn, the Town-Houſe or Court, with all the Houſes of the Citizens; excepting that of the Town-Clark, and a little Shed, not far from the Court, in which was kept the Engines, on which the Flames, (which makes us wonder) never exerciſed it's Fury, but the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> is ſtill ſtanding without a Roof: The Bells were melted down, the Organs and the Altar ſpared; all things mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appeared.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe that were burnt, are Two and Twenty Regulars, and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Seven others; and we fear many more, who are not yet diſcovered.

The hopes of ſaving their Lives made them flye to <hi>Subteranus Vaults:</hi> One Man, thinking to avoid that intollerable heat, made his <hi>Sanctuary</hi> his <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> the <hi>Oven,</hi> in which he thought to have ſecured his tender Fleſh from Raging Flames, proved the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rne</hi> of his pulverated Carcaſe.</p>
            <p>A large Cheſt, in which the Citizens and Country People had treaſured up their Wealth, and depoſited in the Church, as a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> againſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine of hungry Soldiers, who like <hi>Locuſt,</hi> have for ſome years over-ſpread and infeſted thoſe Countrys, was at the beginning of this horrible Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, drawn forth into the Church-Yard and there devoured by Flames, with the Wooden Croſſes that graced the Tombes of ſlumbering Saints.</p>
            <p>The Cattle periſhed, one <hi>Cow</hi> only eſcaping; the Hair and Ears being burnt off.</p>
            <p>So great was the horror and confuſion of theſe poor Wretches, and ſo violently raged the Flames; that all their Wealth and Subſtance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed before they could reach the City Gates. A little Trunk belonging to a Lady, in which was Money and Jewels, valued at Ten Millions of Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; being mounted on a Porters back, thinking to have ſaved it from the Flames, not far from the City Gates the <hi>Iron-Ring</hi> broak by which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it; and down it fell, the Fire purſued ſo cloſe, the Porter to ſave his Life was forc'd to run and leave his Treaſure, which was ſoon devoured by the raging Element, but the melted <hi>Maſs</hi> was after found.</p>
            <p>The Goods that was caſt into Wells, and Pools, was in a manner with the Water dryed, and burnt up; the Chains and Winals, with which they drew Water looked like Fire-brands, ſo that no man with his hands could endure to touch them; almoſt impoſſible was it, for man to find a paſſage out of the City: Some ran one way, ſome another, the Flames ſtill met &amp; purſued them. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhriks filled every corner; Children loſt their Antient Parents; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers left their tender Babes: and happy was he, that by his ſwiftneſs could eſcape, which none did, but thoſe that left in the Flames their Hair and Cloaths, as pawns for their Lives. The memory of man hath not heard of ſo ſudden and terrible a Conflagration; the Deſtruction of this City being as total as that of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſcarce any man, knowing the Foundation of his late Habitation.</p>
            <p>Thus Dear Sir, as brief as I could, have I drawn you the Scene of their miſeries, having rid three <hi>German</hi> Leagues out of my way to view the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, and obſerve the poor Inhabitants ſcattered about the Fields in Huts and Tents.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proſecute my Journey for <hi>Vienna,</hi> where I hope to receive your Letters and Bills, and in the intrim am,</p>
